This directory contains the materials I use or generate in each lecture, including Jupyter transcripts and slides. It also includes ipad/whiteboard images from the Fall 2020 online CS 111 class. It doesn't include any recorded videos, which are too big for this site; to find those, go to GauchoSpace.
