[This online paper by Gabriel Goh](https://distill.pub/2017/momentum/)
starts with a great slider-controlled
demo of the effect of steplength and momentum in optimizing the
Rosenbrock function, and then has a well-written mathematical
explanation of what is really going on in gradient descent with
momentum.
